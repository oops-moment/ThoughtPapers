# ThoughtPapers  

Hi there!  

Welcome to **ThoughtPapers**, where I take complex research papers and break them down into simple, digestible insights.  

I know reading entire papers can be overwhelming (trust me, I’ve been there), but don’t worry—I’ve got you covered. For every paper I read, I share my take on Medium. These articles are quick 5–10 minute reads, perfect for getting the gist without the grind.  

### Featured Paper  
**PAPER**: WTF: Who to Follow on Twitter  
**Read on Medium**: [WTF: How Twitter Decides "Who to Follow"](https://medium.com/@prishaarora1412/wtf-how-twitter-decides-who-to-follow-770440252ac2)
